# lineFollower
A Python project involving a Raspberry Pi, PiCamera, and the OpenCV libraries. A Work-In-progress.

Using a Raspberry Pi, PiCamera module, and a motor hat, the intention of the program will be able to see what is in front of it,
and move accordingly. The goal is for it to distinguish lines and follow them (black lines on a white surface, vice versa, and
hopefully a mix of colours). Additionally, it should be able to turn smoothly, stop appropriately upon seeing specific object
or colour cues (i.e. red to stop, yellow to reverse, etc). 

Credits to the OpenCV developers and 'Out of the BOTS' on YouTube for the tutorials and the code to start off basic functionality.
